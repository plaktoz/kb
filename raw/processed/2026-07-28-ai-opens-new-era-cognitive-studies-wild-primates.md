Novel method automates lab-style testing in the field, tailored to individuals.

Scientists created an AI system that uses facial recognition and real-time, touchscreen testing to automate cognitive studies of capuchin monkeys in the wild.

The American Journal of Primatology published a proof-of-concept for the novel method — dubbed CapuchinAI — developed by researchers at Emory University and Georgia Institute of Technology. The article provides a roadmap for the first scalable, systematic way to evaluate and monitor the cognitive abilities of wild primates.

"The primate brain didn't evolve in a lab, it evolved in complex, competitive environments," says Marcela Benítez, Emory assistant professor of anthropology and senior author of the paper. "Yet primate cognition is rarely studied in the wild because the experimental control needed to measure cognition is difficult in unpredictable environments."

"CapuchinAI" integrates a compact, battery-powered computing system into a field-research platform. The system identifies an approaching monkey, presents a learning task tailored to that individual on a touchscreen, and automatically delivers a food reward if the monkey performs the task correctly.

Field tests of the prototype in the Taboga Forest Reserve of Costa Rica found that CapuchinAI identifies individual capuchins with 97% accuracy, following training on still images and videos. Wild capuchins rapidly habituated and learned touchscreen-reward associations, demonstrating that the system provides a scalable field method for cognitive testing, while also mapping individual differences across tasks.

"This project builds on the legacy of Frans de Waal," says Federico Sánchez Vargas, first author of the paper and an Emory PhD student in anthropology. De Waal pioneered studies of animal cognition as director of Emory's Living Links Center for the Advanced Study of Ape and Human Evolution and passed away in 2024.

Co-authors of the paper include Jacob Abernethy, Georgia Tech associate professor of computer science; and Sai Rakshith Potluri, a former Georgia Tech graduate research assistant who is now a software engineer at ExtraHop in Seattle.

## How the system was built

A seed grant from Emory's AI.Humanity program launched a collaboration between Benítez and Abernethy to design an AI model for facial recognition of wild capuchins. Abernethy and Potluri used an open-source software known as YOLO (You Only Look Once) to develop a model to run on a laptop, trained on high-quality GoPro imagery of six wild capuchins. Emory and Georgia Tech undergraduate students performed the labor-intensive task of digitally placing "bounding boxes" to frame the faces of the monkeys in thousands of still images and videos tagged with their identities. The result was a facial-recognition system that could identify these six capuchins with 97% accuracy from static images, video and live footage in the field.

Sánchez Vargas then integrated the facial-recognition model into a field-friendly, scalable computer interface that could present tasks to interacting capuchins and dispense food rewards. Using Python, he adapted the model so instead of classifying individual capuchin faces, the system recognized any capuchin monkey — and only capuchins — triggering a webcam to record video whenever a capuchin approached a touchscreen, generating a larger dataset of faces for continued training.

A second Python script uses a program called "pygame" to facilitate interactive stimuli. The researchers created a simple stimulus to habituate the monkeys to the system: a blue square covering the computer touchscreen that records when a capuchin touches it, triggering a motor circuit to dispense a food reward.

The two Python scripts run simultaneously on a Raspberry Pi. The entire system can run for eight hours on a lightweight battery pack before it needs recharging.

The researchers built a wildlife-proof, weather-proof wooden platform — about 20 inches tall — to house the system's components: a webcam, a computer touchscreen, the Raspberry Pi, a food dispenser, and a rotary motor. Emory TechLab helped create a 3D printed, plastic food dispenser.

## Field testing in Costa Rica

Upon arriving at the Capuchinos de Taboga facility in Costa Rica, the team secured the CapuchinAI box to a platform, loaded its food dispenser with dried slices of forest banana, and waited. For the first couple of days, no capuchins visited. On the third day, a large male capuchin named Trompudo ("big snout") slapped the touchscreen and a banana slice popped out. He quickly learned the touch-to-reward association, and more monkeys began engaging with the system.

The researchers are noting individual differences within the 16 monkeys who engaged with the CapuchinAI prototype during the pilot phase. Some capuchins are remarkably fast learners; others take more time. Individuals who investigated the box with their lips learned to kiss the screen to get a banana slice. Others hang back and watch their friends interact with the box before approaching it.

The box stood up to occasional aggressive moves by capuchins, and the facial-recognition software prevents the system from activating when other wildlife (including coatis, notorious for breaking into containers) approach.

## What's next

The research team is now updating its facial-recognition model, training it on the recorded videos of the 16 capuchins from the pilot phase. They are developing cognitive experiments for four broad domains of cognition: learning ability, impulse control, cognitive flexibility, and short- and long-term memory.

If the model recognizes a capuchin it was trained on, it presents a specific cognitive test depending on the individual's "level" in the testing sequence. If the individual is unfamiliar, the model assigns the baseline habituation stimulus. Machine vision allows the model to quickly shift tests from one identified capuchin to another so multiple individuals can participate, and the system limits food rewards per individual per session to discourage a dominant capuchin from monopolizing the platform.

The open-source paper includes a guide to the computer coding developed for the system, along with a blueprint to build a low-tech, low-cost field-research platform. The authors hope other scientists will adapt their AI method to generate cognitive data spanning different species of wild primates, living in a range of environments.
